    "**Your answer:** \n",
    "Not in general, it depends on the application (cancer screening for instance), but in either case such a high accuracy score is worthy of suspicion. A very high accuracy score could mean we sampled our data in poor fashion, or that we have a large class imbalance. Upon further invesetigation, it appears that around ~85% of our observations belong to the \"Not Spam\" or 0 class. When we train our model, it may learn just to predict that an observation is not spam, as it will yield to high accuracy (lowest possible value of 85%). This is exactly why we use F-1 score as its the harmonic mean of precision and recall, and gives us a better understanding on how our model performs for all combinations of true, false, positive, and negative classifications, and helps circumvent class imbalance.

    "It seems like the majority of the false negatives had to do with tokens being present in the text that didn't appear frequently enough to make our max_feature cutoff, but still would be very informative for the task of determining if something was spam or not. For instance, many of the spam messages have some numbers in their text, like a phone number line to call. These numbers are normally rather unique, and don't get incorporated into our vocabulary list that often. Perhaps adding a binary feature that detected the presence of numbers in each row of observation data could enhance performance and reduce the occurance of False Negatives. Whereas for the False Positives, it appears that messages that have text that uses words like \"call\",\"text\",\"sms\",\"msg\" are being classified incorrectly. This is most likely due to the fact that most spam messages have a similar call to action, to try to bait their victims to engage with them further. True negatives normally were just texts composed of strings, with no numbers in them, while True positives normally had some number in them, a call to action, or something having to do with communication."
