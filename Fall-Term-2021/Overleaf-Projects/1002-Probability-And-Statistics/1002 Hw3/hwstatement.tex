Unless stated otherwise, justify any answers you give.
You can work in groups, but each
student must write their own solution based on their own
understanding of the problem.

When uploading your homework to Gradescope you will have to
select the relevant pages for each question.  Please submit each
problem on a separate page (i.e., 1a and~1b can be on the same page but 1
and 2 must be on different pages).  We understand that this may be
cumbersome but this is the best way for the grading team to grade your
homework assignments and provide feedback in a timely manner.  Failure
to adhere to these guidelines may result in a loss of points.
Note that it may take some time to
select the pages for your submission.  Please plan accordingly.  We
suggest uploading your assignment at least 30 minutes before the deadline
so you will have ample time to select the correct pages for your
submission.  If you are using \LaTeX, consider using the minted or
listings packages for typesetting code.
